# Contributing to Awaitter Lite

**Thank you for your interest in Awaitter Lite!** ❤️

We welcome contributions! 🎉 **But we're very selective to maintain quality and vision.**

---

## ✅ What We Accept

### 🟢 High Priority (Fast Review)

- 🐛 **Bug Fixes** - Small, isolated fixes for reported issues
- 📝 **Documentation** - Typos, clarifications, examples
- 🌍 **Translations** - Help us reach more developers
- ✅ **Tests** - Additional test coverage

### 🟡 Medium Priority (Case-by-Case)

- ✨ **Small Features** - Must align with our roadmap (ask first!)
- ♻️ **Refactoring** - Only if significantly improves code quality
- 🎨 **UI/UX** - Improvements to CLI interface

### 🔴 What We DON'T Accept

- 🚫 Large features without prior approval
- 🚫 Breaking changes (unless critical)
- 🚫 Style-only changes (we have our standards)
- 🚫 Dependency updates (we handle these)
- 🚫 Complete rewrites or major refactors

---

## 📋 Process (MUST FOLLOW)

### Step 1: Open an Issue FIRST

**⚠️ PRs without an approved Issue will be auto-closed**

1. Search existing Issues to avoid duplicates
2. Open a new Issue describing:
   - The problem you're solving
   - Your proposed solution
   - Why it's important
3. Wait for approval from maintainers (tag: `approved`)
4. Only then start coding

### Step 2: Keep it Small

- ✅ Max **200 lines changed** per PR
- ✅ **Single responsibility** - one thing at a time
- ✅ **One commit** (we'll squash on merge anyway)

Large changes? Split into multiple PRs.

### Step 3: Quality Standards

Your PR must:

- ✅ **Pass all tests** - `npm test` must succeed
- ✅ **Include types** - Full TypeScript typing
- ✅ **No new dependencies** - Unless absolutely critical
- ✅ **Update docs** - README/docs if behavior changes
- ✅ **Follow style** - Use existing code style

### Step 4: Submit PR

Use our PR template (auto-filled) and:

1. Link to the approved Issue
2. Describe what you changed
3. Explain how you tested it
4. Be patient for review (1-7 days)

### Step 5: Review Process

- We may request changes
- We may reject even good PRs (roadmap conflicts)
- Don't take it personally - it's about project vision
- We'll provide feedback to help you improve
